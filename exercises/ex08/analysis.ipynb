When brainstorming, try not to be critical of the ideas you come up with regarding scale, stakeholders impacted, or for any other reasons. In the markdown cell below, brainstorm 3 to 5 ideas you think would create value for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each brainstormed idea should state a. the suggested change or addition, b. what the expected value created, and c. which specific stakeholders would benefit.  If helpful, expand on the following template \"The course should (state idea here) because it will (state value created here) for (insert stakeholders here).\"\n",

    "1. This course should consider having an end of the week low stakes review on gradescope and allows students to ask questions about certain things related to what we covered in class to clear up any misconceptions or needed reviews.\n",
    "2. This course should consider more real life applicable exercises such as survey analysis so students can analyze data and understand that data more since there aren't a majority of computer science majors in this course that would deem these exercises relevant to their course work.\n",
    "3. This course should also consider including a section in the post lesson questions that has ananonmus survey on what part of the material was confusing so that students feel more prone to work through those confusing concepts with TAs instead of struggling during exercises.\n",
    "4. This course should consider having TA's and the instructor input more xercises esepcially with constructing functions and environment diagrams outside of quiz reviews so that students can still challenge themselves as they work on class exercises to sharpen their skills. \n",
    "5. This course should consider weekly review sessions outside of class and not the review sessions that are before the actual quiz day because that leaves little to no room for students that may need the extara help or may have classes or work druring the review day. Review days should be throughout the week prior to quiz day."

The data is found in the `survey.csv` file in this exercise directory. Each row represents an individual survey response.

In the box below, identify which of your ideas lacks data and suggest how we might be able to collect this data in the future. One aspect of _continuous improvement_ is trying to avoid \"tunnel vision\" where possible improvements are not considered because there is no data available to analyze it.

Also this idea does not consider averages for quiz scores to see if people are seriously understanding. \n",
    "2. Suggestion for how to collect data to support this idea in the future: \n",
    "Maybe asking a question that if there is a need to have weekly reviews because tutoring sessions are good to answer questions but there is not a lot of material to practice with to go over in tutoring. In the future the survey should ask how many times people have to resubmit assignments, and what their scores are so far for their quizzes and lessons results. "

This idea is more valuable than the others brainstormed because: This would hopefully reduce the amount of times students would go to office hours, find concepts easier to understand, feel comfortable asking questions in the course and finish their exercises and learning lessons days prior to their due date and have time to study for quizzes/exams.\n"
